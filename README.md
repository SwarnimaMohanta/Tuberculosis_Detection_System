<h1>📌 Sign Language Digit Recognition</h1>
This project is a real-time sign language digit recognition system that uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, and a deep learning model (CNN) to detect and recognize hand gestures representing digits (0–9). It provides both visual and voice feedback for accessibility and smooth interaction.

<h3>🚀 Features</h3>
Real-Time Hand Detection: Uses MediaPipe Hands for accurate detection and tracking of finger positions.

Finger Counting & Gesture Detection: Counts extended fingers for quick numeric detection.

Deep Learning Model (CNN): Trained on a custom Sign Language Digits Dataset for higher recognition accuracy.

Voice Feedback: Uses pyttsx3 for instant spoken output of detected numbers.

Data Augmentation: Improves model generalization using rotation, zoom, brightness adjustment, and shifts.

Multi-Hand Support: Detects and counts fingers from both hands simultaneously.

Optimized for Smooth Performance: Non-blocking audio processing and lightweight video handling.

<h3>🛠️ Technologies Used</h3>
Python – Core programming language

OpenCV – Real-time image capture and processing

MediaPipe – Hand landmark detection

Keras & TensorFlow – CNN model training and prediction

NumPy – Array and image data handling

scikit-learn – Dataset splitting & evaluation
