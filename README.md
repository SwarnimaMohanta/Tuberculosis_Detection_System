<h1>🩺 AI-Powered Tuberculosis Detection System with ICU Recommendation</h1>

This project is an AI-driven medical imaging tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in detecting Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-rays and assessing the severity of infection.

Built with Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, and a clean Bootstrap UI, the system provides not only TB detection but also an ICU recommendation module that classifies patients into High, Moderate, or Low risk categories — helping clinicians prioritize urgent cases.
