<h1>ü©∫ AI-Powered Tuberculosis Detection System with ICU Recommendation</h1>

This project is an AI-driven medical imaging tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in detecting Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-rays and assessing the severity of infection.

Built with Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, and a clean Bootstrap UI, the system provides not only TB detection but also an ICU recommendation module that classifies patients into High, Moderate, or Low risk categories ‚Äî helping clinicians prioritize urgent cases.
